/* 
Detect Cycle in a Linked List
Problem Statement: Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.â€‹

Approach: Use two pointers (slow and fast). The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
